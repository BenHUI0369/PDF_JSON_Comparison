We believe that staggered working hours empower our employees to be more creative and productive.",

Although this is unpaid leave, employees on sabbatical still enjoy selected staff benefits such as annual leave, medical, training and the use of recreation facilities.",

					"Our Flexible Working Policy was launched in mid-2019. We introduced the Staggered Working Hours initiative to allow employees to arrive or leave the office at flexible times provided they are present during specified core working hours. Employees are able to balance their work with their personal commitments, helping advance our goal of building a more people-centric workplace culture. We believe that staggered working hours empower our employees to be more creative and productive.",
					"To augment this policy, we also launched the Sabbatical Leave Policy in January 2020. Sabbaticals allow an employee an extended period away from work, during which time they may recharge themselves, adjust to any life transitions, dedicate time to family matters, or develop their skillsets in various areas. Although this is unpaid leave, employees on sabbatical still enjoy selected staff benefits such as annual leave, medical, training and the use of recreation facilities.",
					"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continuously initiated other working alternatives across our offices, including distributed work, work-from-home and telecommuting arrangements. These policies vary according to need and geography."

We have worked, and will continue to work, towards fostering an inclusive and supportive working environment for all our people by creating an environment where everyone feels comfortable and able to reach their full potential. This year, we developed targets around gender balance, seeking to maintain a workplace female representation of no less than 40%. In 2022, 40.2% of our workforce was female, with 38.3% of senior management positions held by women. Our gender pay ratio is very close to full equality, with the ratio being 1:0.98 (female to male) in 2022.",

Employees were asked to rate the company’s efforts and effectiveness in fostering creative transformation, originality, workplace inclusivity, role empowerment, safe space for open dialogue, and work environment. Additionally, the survey examined factors related to people management, employee recognition, reward initiatives, and programs promoting mental health awareness. These factors serve as indicators for measuring workplace well-being, contributing to employees’ happiness and stress management. The survey provided valuable insights into various aspects of the company culture and practices that contribute to employee engagement and satisfaction. The information allows the company to develop targeted strategies, creating a positive and fulfilling workplace that contribute to the company success.",
					"570 employees across Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland took part in the survey, with a 100% response rate. Under the aspect of  “Employee Engagement”, selected questions on assessing employees’ job satisfaction, sense of purpose, wellbeing, happiness and stress have been asked. The results paint an encouraging picture: an average of 88% of the surveyed employees reported being engaged – the same level reported in our 2020 People Engagement Survey. This figure outperforms the local markets and global benchmarks. Two categories, “Change Management” and “Originality”, also saw a marked improvement over the 2020 survey, while staff communication was also excellent, with 360 staff providing a total of 800 written comments. In 2022, we also conducted an 100% response rate engagement survey for all of our Miami, U.S.A. employees, with engagement index reaching 94%. An important 2025 KPI in this performance category is improving our net promoter score (“NPS”) by 10%. In the 2020 survey, our NPS was 16%; in the 2022 survey it was 23%."

The collected books are sorted and categorised by our Community Ambassadors and volunteers from our NGO partners, and then sold for HKD10 per book. This year’s event mobilised 6,000 volunteers, with the proceeds raised going to The Boys’ & Girls’ Clubs Association of Hong Kong and the Agency for Volunteer Service."

					"The Uncomfortable Conversations initiative has three main goals: to promote, pledge and empower everyone, especially men, to actively work to strengthen bonds within our community; to advocate for underrepresented people in day-to-day settings; and to ensure that D&I issues are actively considered and implemented in recruitment, job flexibility, promotions and rewards. While the series acknowledges that some discussions may cause discomfort, it is believed that important and necessary changes can be made to attitudes, communications, engagement and culture through honest and open discussions."
